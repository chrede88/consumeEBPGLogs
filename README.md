# consumeEBPGLogs

This is a small CLI tool created to easily comsume logs from a Raith EBPG electron beam writer.

## Install
It's recommended to install this using [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io). pipx installs each package in an isolated environment, which mitigates depedency version issues.

```sh
pipx install https://github.com/chrede88/comsumeEBPGLogs
```
